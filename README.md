Alfred workflow â€” DOS to UNIX path
====================

*Translate a given DOS path (file or folder) to a UNIX path and reveal it with Finder*

For the times when your coworkers give you DOS path to files on your network and
you want to get there quickly, use this.

## Advice

For an easier use, mounted volumes must have the same name on both PC and Mac computers on your network.

## Usage

Type the keyword **"path"** then type the DOS path you want to convert.

It will open Finder to *file:///Volumes/C/Share/specs*

## Features

- The new converted UNIX path will be pasted in your clipboard.
